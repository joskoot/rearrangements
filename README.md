# rearrangements
rearrangements of a list (often called permutations)

For a long list it is not possible to produce all rearrangements,
but it is possible to produce a representation in terms of a function
that given index k returns the k-th rearrangement.

An inverse function is included.
Given a rearrangement, it returns the index.
